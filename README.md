# Saalispäiväkirja

Probably doesn't run on your computer because I'm too lazy to fix it. You can admire code, though!

My first "real" program ever, made as a course project for the university course "Programming 2". Written in Java, it's a fishing diary with CRUD functions and a GUI. Isn't she beautiful?

Only available in Finnish, I'm afraid.
